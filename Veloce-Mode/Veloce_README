Description:
To get the design running on veloce, we had to remove few non-synthesizable portions of the protocol and code. The goal of the veloce
portion of our project was to make the environment synthesizable and run on veloce. 

Verification:
Since assertions module was removed, the design can be verified be writing & reading from the subsequent address.
The checker module has been implemented in the top_tb & can work only for the current environment configuration.


Features of protocol implemented:	
		Basic Read, Write, Burst Read, Burst Write for length of 4.
		Busy & wait states capability not implemented.
		Configurable No of Slaves; Presently configured to work with 2 slaves; Limit on No of Slaves to 4
		Slave has Read only addresses.
